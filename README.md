# Matrix Testing

[![Matrix Testing](https://github.com/mkeohane01/MatrixTesting-MP4/actions/workflows/matrixtest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mkeohane01/MatrixTesting-MP4/actions/workflows/matrixtest.yml)

By using Matrix Testing I was able to test whether my code runs as expected in various python versions. In this repository I am testing python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.
